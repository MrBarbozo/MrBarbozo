- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrBarbozo
- This account is made to show off the code I make in my frretime, along with any I make whilst at school.
-  Reach me at raphaelpjbarbosa@outlook.com or raphaelpjbarbosa@gmail.com.
-  Im not that experienced in coding so dont really expect much at all from me.
-  Also its worth mentioning most my codes are cow boy themed so there wont be much use in using them to cheat on your computer science tests :/.
